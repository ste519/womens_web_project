      <p>
        This website started as an idea when Kelsey Toporski was a freshman in college taking my first <a
          href="https://lsa.umich.edu/content/michigan-lsa/wgs/en.html"> Women's Studies</a> class. As a junior, she had
        the skill set to make it
        happen. Growing up in a small, rural, conservative town, this class was really her first introduction to
        feminism and feminist thought, and she wanted to share her new found knowledge with others. This website is
        where a lot of feminist things could be compiled in one place, purely because people might not otherwise know
        about it. Her hometown may not have been forward thinking, but it did have internet connection.

        This website currently contains 3 pages other than this one - click below to see a short description of each!

        <h3>Kelsey's DISCLAIMER:</h3>
        <p>
          I did not know everything!! I'm only human - I'm still growing and learning and I have a limited knowledge of
          things, but I will do my best and work to make this page as inclusive and unbiased as possible.
